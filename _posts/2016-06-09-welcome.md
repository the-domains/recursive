  This is, for the time being, a place for me to get my head wrapped around the
  potential offered by an AI-driven web publishing platform. My interest in the

This is, for the time being, a place for me to get my head wrapped around the potential offered by an AI-driven web publishing platform. My interest in the subject is broad, but I am specifically interested in how such technologies might be used to make personalized learning more...well, personalized.

In a [TED talk from 2011][0], Tim Harford discusses how we naturally gravitate toward a process of trial and error in many areas of our lives, but we fall victim to what he calls the "God complex" when we substitute our "expertise" or our "knowledge" for a more experimental approach. This leads to problems where we dismiss the complexity of a problem with simple answers that are too shallow to make a difference.

Design and planning of all kinds tends to suffer when those involved feel they have to have all of the answers up front. Creativity and innovation are iterative practices. Our culture doesn't tend to value the crumpled up pile of paper in the corner as a symbol of creativity, but no novel was ever written without a multitude of edits. We expect beauty and perfection to explode on the scene fully formed. This fairy tale, however, also tends to increase our anxiety when we're tasked with getting something done, as we can't see an easy pathway from where we are to where we need to be.

Crumple things up. Embrace the pile.
